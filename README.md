# Overview

This was a take on a few different guides and ChatGPT to see if I could understand more about node.js and how to implement a database into my earlier idea of an authentication system. This carries a similar structure with an html file to hold the base and then the typescript to procide details. Most of the guides and random information I found had stuff broken up so I tried to follow that guideline but at the moment can not run my code. the node app.js doesn't start the server as expected so I will need to continue learning a bit more about express and how to pass all the modules around in the files to check it all is at least typed as expected.

This is to show how far just a few weeks of guides and AI can help someone learn. This program is still not the best for a production enviornment but shows that just a few hours each day can result in quite a bit of code being created and worked on.

Due to the node.js functionality not working I do not have a video at this time. I am getting busy with school and work so will have to put this project on the backburner for a little while but will update when finished.

# Development Environment

My main tools were Visual Studio Code, Youtube tutorials on: Node.js, implementing sqlite3 into a html program, and then ChatGPT to answer questions and clarify whay lines did from the tutorials. And a few, with this error what can I do to fix it. Still don't understand all the npm commands and how node.js works, but have a bisic understanding of what it should be doing.

The main focus is Typescript that then has to get compiled into Javascript. Many libraries had to be installed with npm install ... to allow for the various files to all work with express, sqlite3, types, and trying to get a server started to test on a localhost.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- working server to run locally
- figure out more about the async functions that run the database. I had some errors with those but havn't been able to run the server to check if I fixed the problem.
- encryption on usernames and passwords in database.
